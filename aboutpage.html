				<p><strong>Rules</strong></p>
				<p>As you are engaged in the run you need to be sure that the foods that you decide to eat are beneficial to your overall health.</p>
			  <p> For example: if you eat foods that are fun to eat but do not eat anything except these &quot;red&quot; type foods, then your character will become slow and fat! </p>
				<p>For example: if you eat too many &quot;green&quot; type foods, then your characyer will become slow and tired!</p>
				<p>For example: if you eat a <u><strong>balance</strong></u> (indicated by the nutrition bar) of &quot;green&quot; and &quot;red&quot; type foods then you will reach the coveted maximum balance. </p>
			</div>
            <div class="tabs-pane" id="tab4">
